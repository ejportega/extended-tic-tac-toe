# Extendend-tic-tac-toe
The game will be played in a 6x6 grid.  

Each player will take turns in placing a mark (X or O) in the grid.
Unlike the traditional tic-tac-toe, a player can only put a mark on the lowest available
space in a column.

A player wins by completing a sequence of four (4) of their marks in a
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
